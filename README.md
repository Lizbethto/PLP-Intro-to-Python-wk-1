# My Python Assignment: Basic Calculator Program
## Introduction
Hi! This repository contains a simple Python program I created as part of a class assignment. The goal was to practice using variables, arithmetic operations, string formatting, and data types in Python. It also helped me get more comfortable with user input and conditional logic.

## Assignment Objective
The main purpose of this task was to:
Practice creating Python programs that can perform calculations
Learn how to collect input from users
Experiment with variables and different data types
Use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to control program behavior

## What the Program Does
My program works like a basic calculator. It:
Asks the user to input two numbers
Asks the user to select an operation (+, -, *, /)
Performs the operation based on what the user selected
Displays the result as a full expression (e.g. 10 + 5 = 15)
Checks for errors like division by zero and shows a friendly message if needed

## Instructions from the Assignment
We were asked to:
Create a simple Python script
Let the user enter two numbers
Ask for the type of operation they want to do
Perform the operation
Print the result
Include simple error handling (especially for division)

## What I Learned
Working on this helped me understand:
How to use input() and convert strings to numbers
The difference between int and float
How to control program flow using if...elif...else
How to write clean, readable output using formatted strings
How to handle edge cases (like dividing by zero)

## How to Run My Program
To test the calculator:
Make sure Python is installed on your system
Clone or download this repository
Open your terminal and run:
python calculator.py
